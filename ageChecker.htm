How this program works:

    When the page loads a prompt() method will request that the viewer enter their age.
    A command button will be clicked by the viewer after he or she has provided their age. Hint, use a generic form button, NOT a submit button. Example: <button>My Button</button>.
    The viewer will be redirected to the appropriate Web site based on the age they entered when prompted to do so.

Follow these steps:

    Create a Web (.html) page named ageChecker.html. This page must include a command button and some text explaining to the viewer that they will be redirected to an appropriate Web site after they provide their age and click the button.
    In the head element of your .html file, create a script element. Inside the script element, code a prompt() method that will provide an area for the user to enter their age. You may assume that the viewer will enter a whole (integer) number between 5 and 95. Assign that value to a variable named "theAge". Don't forget to use the parseFloat() or parseInt() method to ensure that you populate your variable with numeric data.
    In your script element, create a function named myRedirect(). When this function is called, based on the viewer's age stored in your "theAge" variable, create an if/else statement  that will redirect the viewer to http://www.disney.com/ if they are under the age of 21. If they are 21 or older, redirect them to http://www.espn.com/ after the command button is clicked (this is an onclick event). Determining which site to redirect the viewer to is the job of your if/else condition (see Chapter 4).
    Code an event listener so that when the button is clicked your function named myRedirect() executes the code contained with its curly brackets.
    Test your code to make sure the user is properly redirected; ESPN for 21 and over, Disney for all others.
