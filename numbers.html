Create a Web (.html) page named numbers.html. Create a script element inside the body element of your web page. Create a while loop that will write to your Web page every third number between 0 and 101 (your first number should be 1). These numbers should each appear on a new line. Hint: use the document.write() method for your page output and include a <br> element in your.
Note: Your text uses the document.writeln() method to write text to your Web page. This method is supposed to create a new line as if a line break were applied. It only works if applied in conjunction with a pre element which is a terrible idea so stick with the document.write() method and add a break tag as shown in your text.

Your output will look like this:
1
4
7
10
13
etc. until the last number:
100
